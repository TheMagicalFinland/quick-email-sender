# quick-email-sender
Another side project I made when I was just beginning to reach out of the beginner level of JavaScript skills.

You need to install the required packages using the following commands on your node.js console:
- npm i readline-sync
- npm i nodemailer
- npm i os
- npm i console-title

or you may download the executable file from project.zip and run it, but this prevents you from editing it though.

I'd like to add a quick note here years after the publishation of the release of this specific repo (07.12.2023) that the program will no longer work as Google removed the possibility for untrusted applications to access their emailing system:

"To help keep your account secure, from May 30, 2022, ​​Google no longer supports the use of third-party apps or devices which ask you to sign in to your Google Account using only your username and password.

Important: This deadline does not apply to Google Workspace or Google Cloud Identity customers. The enforcement date for these customers will be announced on the Workspace blog at a later date."
