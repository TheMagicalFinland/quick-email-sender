# quick-email-sender
Another side project I made when I was just beginning to reach out of the beginner level of JavaScript skills.

You need to install the required packages using the following commands on your node.js console:
- npm i readline-sync
- npm i nodemailer
- npm i os
- npm i console-title

or you may download the executable file from project.zip and run it, but this prevents you from editing it though.

I'd like to add a quick note here years after the publishation of the release of this specific repo (07.12.2023) that the program will no longer work as Google removed the possibility for untrusted applications to access their emailing system.
